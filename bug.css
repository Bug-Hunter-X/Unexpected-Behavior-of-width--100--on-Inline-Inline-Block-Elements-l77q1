The CSS rule `.box { width: 100%; }` does not work as expected when the parent element has `display: inline;` or `display: inline-block;`.  The width of the `.box` element will not be 100% of its containing element's width. This is because inline and inline-block elements do not expand to fill the width of their parent, even if explicitly set using width: 100%;
