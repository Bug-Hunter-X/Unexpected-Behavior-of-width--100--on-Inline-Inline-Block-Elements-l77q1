This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered in CSS when attempting to set the width of an element to 100% of its parent's width, where the parent has a display style of inline or inline-block.  The `bug.css` file showcases the problem, while `solution.css` provides a fix.  The issue arises from the inherent behavior of inline and inline-block elements, which do not naturally expand to fill their parent's width. The solution involves altering the parent's display property or utilizing other techniques to achieve the desired layout.
